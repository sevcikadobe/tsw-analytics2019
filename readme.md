### Tips
* Limit the team to less than 10 slides total (excluding cover slide)
* The presentation should be telling a story with a message that threads thru from the opening-to-demo-to-closing
* Don’t speak about a features and capabilities unless there is a value to the customer use case
* The demo is part of the story, not ”you know what is cool in the solution?”
* This is sales pitch (i.e not implementation). Know where it can be fake and where it has to work ([Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and free [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) is acceptable sometimes).
